      <h1>Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach</h1>
      <h2>Chapter one: Notes</h2>
      <h3>What is AI?</h3>
      <p>Intelligence is how we think, which we do not fully understand. AI is the search to find a way to model the way we think. We can think about how people act in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thinking rationally: </strong>Based around the concept of structured "logical rules". The standard <em>A is a B, B is a C, therefore A is also a C</em> thinking model. Useful for systems with definite and finite tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Thinking humanely: </strong>Based around cognitive science, trying to mimic how humans think (rather than a logical set of rules).</li>
        <li><strong>Acting rationally: </strong>Something that trys to reach a goal, or preform the best expected outcome. </li>
        <li><strong>Acting humanely: </strong>Attempts to create an AI that responds with actions as we would expect from a human. This is the famious Turing Test where a human observer must determine if responses given are from a human or computer. Such a system must be capable of: <ul>
          <li><strong>Natural language processing: </strong>A way to speak the same language as the human.</li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge representation: </strong>A way to interpret inputs as data.</li>
          <li><strong>Automated reasoning: </strong>To use knowledge data to respond and form new knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Machine learning: </strong>To manage new situations and find patterns</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p>In summary, the book describes AI as modeling the way we humans think, and the common approaches are to either find the logical rules for something that acts rationally, find a way to mimc how humans think, find a way to optimize a goal, or find a way to make other humans believe something is rational.</p>

      <h3>Foundations of AI</h3>
      <p>AI crosses a lot of domains of knowledge and tries to bring models from them togeter into a way we can model a rational agent from them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Philosophy</strong>
          <p>One needs to think about whether or not creating AI is plausable. Questions must probe into areas such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Can we define rules that result in AI?</li>
            <li>How does human thought arise from organic goop?</li>
            <li>How does knowledge work?</li>
            <li>What translates thought and knowledge into actions?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A lot of discussion from philosophers over the past few thousand years has lead to many ideas about how free will works and what scenarios result in such things. In essence, there is the concept of Rationalisim which states there is free will, materialisim which states physical laws determine everything, and dualisim which states the mind is exempt from the physical laws that determine everything else.</p>
          <p>The concept of how knowledge comes into play is based around something called logical positivism, which states that all knowledge is connected by some logical model that depends on our senses. In other words, we can gain knowledge through inputs.</p>
          <p>The final question is how actions come about, which has been presented as the connection between reaching a goal and existing knowledge. In other words, we do our best based on what we know.</p>

      <h3>State of the art</h3>
      <p>We might not have a self-aware HAL9000 just yet, however what have we gained from AI research? The following is a small sample of work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Robotic vehicles: </strong>There has been multiple projects and even contests for designing robotic vehicles, such as those that can drive through the Mojave desert, to those capable of navigating city-streets while obeying trafic rules.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Speech recognition: </strong>We have phone-systems where a computer is capable of determineing what a human wants, and preformes based on speech alone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Autonomous planning and scheduling: </strong>We have autonomous agents planning individual missions for other robotic agents, all based on high-level goals a human gave it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Games: </strong>Perhaps the most famious Deep Blue chess playing computer from IBM that beat the world chess master.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Spam detection: </strong>Static programs that don't learn new spam models are ineffective as spammers will change their methods to beat the bots. Learning algorithms scan billions of junk emails to classify what's spam and what's not to save your inbox from overflowing with junk.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Logistics planning: </strong>In military operations, coordinating tens of thousands of vehicles, cargo and people around a mission would normally take many weeks. Through planning AI we can return the same result in a few hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Robotics: </strong>A popular example is the Roomba vaccume cleaner that autonomusly vaccumes a floor. A branch of this technology works in war-zones to find snipers, clear explosives and work with materials that are hazardous to people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Machine translation: </strong>Thanks to statisical modeling, we can create models that determine an equivilant phrase in one language based on another. For instance, we can translate english-to-arabic despite the languages having differnt grammar structures and not being a direct word replacement but rather each language being vastly differnt and complex. Nobody developing the software is required to speak either language.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
