      <h1>Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach</h1>
      <h2>Chapter one: Notes</h2>
      <h3>What is AI?</h3>
      <p>Intelligence is how we think, which we do not fully understand. AI is the search to find a way to model the way we think. We can think about how people act in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thinking rationally: </strong>Based around the concept of structured "logical rules". The standard <em>A is a B, B is a C, therefore A is also a C</em> thinking model. Useful for systems with definite and finite tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Thinking humanely: </strong>Based around cognitive science, trying to mimic how humans think (rather than a logical set of rules).</li>
        <li><strong>Acting rationally: </strong>Something that trys to reach a goal, or preform the best expected outcome. </li>
        <li><strong>Acting humanely: </strong>Attempts to create an AI that responds with actions as we would expect from a human. This is the famious Turing Test where a human observer must determine if responses given are from a human or computer. Such a system must be capable of: <ul>
          <li><strong>Natural language processing: </strong>A way to speak the same language as the human.</li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge representation: </strong>A way to interpret inputs as data.</li>
          <li><strong>Automated reasoning: </strong>To use knowledge data to respond and form new knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Machine learning: </strong>To manage new situations and find patterns</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p>In summary, the book describes AI as modeling the way we humans think, and the common approaches are to either find the logical rules for something that acts rationally, find a way to mimc how humans think, find a way to optimize a goal, or find a way to make other humans believe something is rational.</p>

      <h3>Foundations of AI</h3>
      <p>AI crosses a lot of domains of knowledge and tries to bring models from them togeter into a way we can model a rational agent from them.</p>
